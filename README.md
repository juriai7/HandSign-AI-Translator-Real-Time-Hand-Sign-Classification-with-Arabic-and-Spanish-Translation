## Overview

**HandSign AI Translator** is a real-time computer vision system that recognizes hand signs using a standard webcam.  
The system detects the hand, extracts landmark features, classifies the sign, translates the result into **Arabic** and **Spanish**, provides **ASL tutor feedback**, and gives **hand distance guidance** to improve recognition accuracy.

Unlike image-based models, this project is **landmark-based**.  
The model does not train on full images, backgrounds, clothes, lighting, or skin color. Instead, it learns from the hand structure extracted by MediaPipe.

## How It Works

```text
OpenCV captures webcam frame
        ↓
MediaPipe detects the hand
        ↓
21 hand landmarks are extracted
        ↓
Each landmark has x, y, z coordinates
        ↓
21 × 3 = 63 numerical features
        ↓
Keras MLP model classifies the sign
        ↓
Prediction is displayed and translated
```

## Word Recognition Module

The word recognition module was developed by **Juri Bandar Almarwani**.

This module classifies five complete hand signs directly from webcam input.  
Instead of spelling words letter by letter, each full hand sign is mapped to one word in a single prediction step.

### Landmark-Based Input

MediaPipe extracts **21 hand landmarks**.  
Each landmark contains:

```text
x, y, z
```

Therefore:

```text
21 landmarks × 3 coordinates = 63 features
```

Each dataset row is stored as:

```text
63 landmark values + label
```

Example:

```text
[0.21, 0.45, -0.02, ..., 0.11] → hi
```

---

## Deep Learning Model

The word recognition model is a **fully connected MLP** built with Keras.

### Model Details

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| Input | 63 MediaPipe landmark features |
| Model Type | Fully Connected MLP |
| Hidden Layers | 512 → 256 → 128 → 64 → 32 |
| Activation | ReLU |
| Stabilization | Batch Normalization |
| Regularization | Dropout |
| Output Layer | 5 neurons |
| Final Activation | Softmax |
| Loss Function | Sparse Categorical Crossentropy |
| Optimizer | Adam |

### Why MLP?

The input is not an image.  
The input is a numerical feature vector of hand landmarks, so a fully connected MLP is suitable for learning the relationship between hand shape and sign class.

---

## Data Collection

The dataset was collected manually using a webcam.

For each hand sign, samples were saved in a CSV file as landmark values, not images.

```text
CSV format:
x0, x1, x2, ... x62, label
```

The model learns from:

```text
Hand geometry → Sign class
```

not from:

```text
Background, lighting, clothes, or image pixels
```

---

## Data Augmentation

Data augmentation was applied to the **landmark numbers**, not to images.

The augmentation included:

| Augmentation | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Noise | Simulates small MediaPipe detection changes |
| Scaling | Simulates the hand being closer or farther |
| Shifting | Simulates small hand movement in the frame |

This helps the model handle natural variations in hand position, size, and movement.

---

## Translation Feature

The system translates recognized text into:

- Arabic
- Spanish

Arabic text requires special rendering because OpenCV does not display Arabic correctly using `cv2.putText()`.

The Arabic rendering pipeline uses:

```text
arabic_reshaper → python-bidi → Matplotlib → OpenCV paste
```

---

## ASL Tutor Mode

The tutor mode helps users practice ASL letters.

The system shows a guide image for the target letter, then checks whether the user signs the correct letter.  
The user must hold the correct sign for several consecutive frames before moving to the next letter.

</p>

## Hand Distance Feedback

The hand distance feature gives feedback when the hand is too close or too far from the camera.

This improves recognition reliability because the same sign can look different when the hand is at different distances.
